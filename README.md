## Hi there 👋

#### I'm Oleksandr.
I work as a Fullstack Software Engineer at SimpliField. I'm a creative web developer with almost 3 years of strong experience in Front-end Development, Back-end Development areas with a willingness to learn and practice Single Page apps, PWA, and hybrid mobile apps.
I have good practical skills in HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJs, Angular 2+, React,  Node.js, MongoDB.
I'm also very interested in Dart and Flutter.

#### 🌱 When I am offline, I walk a lot and read fiction books.
#### 📚 I love the books by Terry Pratchett and Brandon Sanderson.
#### ⚡ Fun fact: this GitHub profile name has roots in Pratchett's books
